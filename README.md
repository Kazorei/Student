Cs50 Week 10: Final Project

 PROJECT TITLE: Student
 Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/4NVuMS1zPo4>
 Description: Student is a webpage featuring three programs that blends my creativity with my passion for programming. It demonstrates my ability to create and implement unique programs, showcasing the skills I've acquired through CS50 and other valuable resources dedicated to learning computer science and programming. Student is an ongoing project that I 
 will be continuing to develop, with futre updates, Student will see improvements made to its UI, functionality, and with the addition of more programs; making a it larger playground for users to enjoy.

 Homepage: 

The Homepage of Student features two unique elements. The first element is visible on the centre of the user's display when loaded into the Students URL. This element of the Homepage consists of a short yet compact dialogue to engage the user and immerse them in their creative minds. As the reader goes through the dialogue, they gradually learn what Student is, and what the applications that are featured on it are, with a hint at the end of the dialogue the users can learn how to access these programs and continue to the second element of Hompage.

On the left of the Homepage, the user can find a navigation bar. This is the second element that the Homepage has available for the user to experience. To begin, the user finds the nav-bar closed, but with the aid of the hint (referenced above) directing them via the dialog or for those who notice it before the dialogue, the user can find a blue arrow pointing away from the nav-bar at the top left of the display.

Upon interaction, the navigation bar will expand, and the user will be greeted with the Projects title 'Student', its emblem (a shaded torus), a search bar (currently not fully developed), named links for the symbolic representation of the programs and features included on the nav-bar, and finally a dark-theme mode that the user can switch to if the brightness is too high on the light-theme mode (Student's default setting). Furthermore, making use of this nav-bar will allow the user to have access to the three main programs on Student, Calculator, 3D Cube and Hangman.

Calculator:

Calculator is a simple online tool that allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It can also be used to calculate percentages.

To use the calculator, simply enter the numbers you want to calculate and press the appropriate operation button. For example, to add two numbers, enter the first number, press the plus button (+), enter the second number, and press the equals button (=).
To calculate a percentage, enter the number you want to calculate the percentage of, press the percent button (%), enter the percentage, and press the equals button (=).

On the top right of the program the user can find a small navitgation-bar, included on it are, Homepage (a dropdown menu that expand once the users mouse engages with the option) and a 'About' feature. The about feature (when interacted with it) explains what the calculator tool is and how to use it. "The first three lines of the calculator descripton was taken directly from the 'About' feature". 

The 'Homepage' dropdown menu includes options to move to and from all avalivle programs and wep-pages accessible on 'Student'. The options are Dashboard (Homepage), 3D Cube, and Hangman. 

3D Cube:

3D Cube is a creative outlet tool for the user to play with and be creative!

With a number of settings displayed to the user on the right-hand side of the program, the user can manipulate the three-dimensional cube by rotating its x, y, and z axes. Additionally, the user can move the starting position of the 3D cube. They can add a maximum of 50 layers of 3D cubes (on top of each other), change the cube's color, shape size and scale factor, manipulate the edge thickness of the cube, tilt the angle (this function is kinda broken but is a great tool nonetheless), and reset the cube back to its original starting value.

Underneath the setting and options for the 3D cube, the user has access to links outside of 3D Cube that can take them to the Dashboard, Calculator, and Hangman pages. If the user wishes to enjoy their creation without the menu display window open, they can close the window on the top right of the menu display via the '-' symbol.

Personal note: A favorite of mine in this program was the addition of 'MATRIX.' Matrix is a color that the user can choose to paint the edges of the 3D cube in a cycle of red, green, and blue colors. This adds an almost psychedelic appearance to the cube and/or cubes (depending on the amount of layers active as of use) and increases the enjoyment factor of the program.

Finishing notes: With the use of the dropdown menu, the user can indulge their creative minds and explore unique designs that they themselves mold into existence. Adding the option to switch between programs allows the user to continue their involvement in Student.

Hangamn:

Hangman is a simple version of the classic game, but it comes with a little surprise, wink wink. The game setup includes a blank space representing the word with missing letters, displayed in empty slots indicating the word's length. Below that, a word hint is provided. Underneath, there's an alphabetical array of letters for the user to pick and choose from, selecting the letters they believe are in the word they're guessing. To the left, inside the game container, there's a Hangman image that changes with each incorrect guess. The closer the image gets to a full Hangman depiction, the closer the user is to losing the game. When the user correctly gusses the letter from the array of letters on screen, the missing word will display the correct gusse from the user and the image will not update.

Outside of the game container there is a question mark at the bottom left of the diaplay, when interacted, a popup window will appear and everything outside of the window will be disabled; you can not interacte with anything outside of the window until the window is closed via the 'x' (close) symbol.

Inside the window the user can find that theyve entered a 'About' feature for the Hangman page. The displays this...

How to Play Hangman

Hangman is a word guessing game. When you start the game, the program will randomly generate a word and display it with blank lines for the missing letters. You will have a limited number of guesses to fill in the blanks and guess the word correctly.

Hint: The hint below the word is usually vague, so be wise with your choices!

Guessing a letter: If you guess the wrong letter, the hangman will be drawn one step closer to completion. Once the hangman is complete, you lose the game. If you guess the correct letter, the letter will be displayed in the word.
Once a letter is chosen, it cannot be chosen again. You continue guessing letters until you have either filled in all the blanks and guessed the word correctly, or you have run out of guesses and have lost the game.

Trick or Treat House Rule:

In true spirit, I've devilishly handed you the first letter for every word. But mwhahha, I haven't disabled the letter, so it's still an option to choose in the game. Be careful, though - the first letter might be one of a kind!

Happy Halloween!

With the game rules explained, you've learned about a slight change in mechanics called the 'Trick or Treat House Rule.' Personally, as I approached the Halloween season, I felt inspired to add a spooky element to Student. The idea of a game program for the final project was always on my mind, and as I worked on it, the concept of a Hangman game emerged. However, as the program neared completion, it lacked Halloween themes. While fixing a bug in the program (where the first letter for every missing word was always showing), I found a solution that led me to create the Halloween-inspired Trick or Treat? House rule. 

Ps. Im very happy with how the house rule plays :)
